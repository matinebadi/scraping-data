Welcome to the **ETL Phone Product Scraper**! This project is a **Python**-based web scraper and API service designed to extract product details from an e-commerce website and store them in a **PostgreSQL** database. Built using **FastAPI** for the web server, **BeautifulSoup** for scraping, and **psycopg2** for interacting with the PostgreSQL database, this tool simplifies the process of extracting, updating, and managing product data.

## üåü **Features**

- **Add Product**: Add new products to the database.
- **Refresh Data**: Automatically refresh product data by scraping the latest information.
- **Update Product**: Modify the details of an existing product.
- **Delete Product**: Remove a product from the database.
- **Show All Products**: Retrieve and display all products in the database.

## üì• **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/etl-phone-scraper.git
   cd etl-phone-scraper

2. Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Set Up PostgreSQL Database:

Create a database named etlphone.

Ensure the table users exists with the following columns:

name

link

price

üöÄ Running the API

To start the FastAPI server, use the following command:

uvicorn main:app --reload

This will run the server at http://127.0.0.1:8000. You can now interact with the following endpoints.

üßë‚Äçüíª How It Works

1. Web Scraping:
The GetDatas function scrapes product data from a predefined e-commerce website using BeautifulSoup. It collects product information such as name, price, category, and description.


2. Database Interaction:
Using psycopg2, the application connects to a PostgreSQL database to add, update, delete, and display product data.


3. FastAPI Server:
The API is built with FastAPI and served using Uvicorn, providing a fast and modern framework for exposing the data to clients.
